week 5 Learning journal

Learning Activities & Resources 
This week I mainly made changes to the child theme. In the process, I pressed F12 on the web page to view its source code and then created a css file in vscode to make modifications.

Estimated Hours Maybe 4 hours in this week because everything almostly finished on class.

Content Insights 
My insight into this week's task is to change WordPress through vscode. I think this can change more details and make modifications more intuitive, because if you make changes directly on the web page, you can only modify the content in the template instead of modifying yourself. Really wanted.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This week I learned a few more techniques about editing WordPress that I think will be very useful in the future.
